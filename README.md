# Extensive Childcare Cost USA: Storytelling

A data storytelling project focused on analyzing the rising cost of childcare in the United States and presenting the findings through visually engaging, fictionalized narratives. This project leverages federal childcare price data, parental survey results, and modern visualization techniques to create impactful stories for public awareness.

## Project Overview

Childcare costs in the U.S. have been steadily increasing, placing financial and emotional strain on families. This project combines data analysis and storytelling to explore these trends and present them in a relatable way for the general public.  

By integrating historical childcare pricing data and survey responses from U.S. parents, the project develops a fictional but data-backed narrative that illustrates the difficult choices families face — such as relocating for affordability or turning to extended family for support. The goal is to simplify complex findings into visually appealing content that resonates with a wide audience.

## Data Sources

- **National Database of Childcare Prices (NDCP)** — U.S. Department of Labor (2008–2022)  
- **Survey of American Parents** — Pew Research Center (Sept. 20 – Oct. 2, 2022)

## Methodology

- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** — Reduced dataset size, standardized column names, formatted values, and handled missing data while preserving integrity  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** —  
  - Geospatial mapping of childcare costs across states and counties  
  - Comparison of center-based vs. family-based care costs by age group  
  - Employment and poverty rate patterns  
  - Parental sentiment analysis from survey data  
- **Story Development** — Created a fictional narrative inspired by data insights to increase relatability and engagement  
- **Mediums for Storytelling** — Instagram post/reel, blog article, and Facebook ad/pamphlet to target diverse age groups and platforms

## Results

- Identified states with the highest childcare prices (California, Washington, New York) and observed sharp post-COVID-19 increases in family-based care costs
- Found that 27% of parents consider relocating due to childcare costs
- Revealed that while 70% of surveyed parents are married, many describe parenting as stressful and financially challenging
- Produced interactive and static visualizations for use in social media and blog content

---

## Future Improvements

- Expand the analysis with additional datasets (e.g., childcare facility incidents, real-time cost data)
- Incorporate predictive modeling for future childcare cost projections
- Enhance interactive dashboards for deeper user exploration
- Deploy the final visuals as an interactive web story platform
